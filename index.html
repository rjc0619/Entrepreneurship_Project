                    a freshman at Dublin High School. Before, I was looking forward
                    to seeking and discovering what I want to do in the future. I did 
                    not know what I wanted to do when I grow up but after taking 
                    the time to think about what I want from the job, I noticed that
                    working in the medical feild will greatly satisfy my wants for
                    my future job...</p>
