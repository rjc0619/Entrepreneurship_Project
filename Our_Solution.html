                        <p class="font-weight-lighter">Our product is called
                        the insuLiquid and it works just as well as a insulated 
                        water bottle. The insuLiquid is a sleeve that is 
                        temperature insulated. If you have a normal bottle and
                        it is not heat insulated, then you can add the
                        insuLiquid to keep the liquid inside a consistent 
                        temperature. Now! You won't have to worry about actually
                        buying an expensive water bottle that is heat insulated.
                        On the outer layer of the sleeve, we decided that it 
                        would be silicone. Not only can silicone insulate the
                        liquids in your water bottle, but it can also increase
                        comfort when holding the bottle. Not only will our product
                        help people keep their drinks insulated, but it can 
                        also motivate people to use more reusable water bottles.
                        For the people who do not have an insulated water bottle,
                        they are able to turn to our product for a much cheaper
                        price. First, we needed to research hydro flasks and 
                        how they work. We conducted research on how hydro flasks 
                        use their vacuum insulation, how long it lasts, the
                        benefits, and the withdrawals. Then, we researched 
                        their silicone sleeve and the pure reasons of it. We
                        researched how it was made, how thick it is, and how 
                        it fits onto the hydro flask. Next, we needed to determine
                        how we would withstand temperature of something. After 
                        this, we determined that there needed to use something
                        simple, like the silicone sleeve, and the ability to 
                        withstand in one product which can be used in multiple
                        products. Because of this idea, we needed to research 
                        if it was possible these two inventions into one 
                        innovation. We read about how to combine these and
                        researched more about heat and the sleeve.</p>
