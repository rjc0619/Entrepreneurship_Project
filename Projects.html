                      <p>Objective: Create a mutistage interactive game</p>
                      <p>September 2018 (2 weeks)</p>
                      <p>In the game, Save the Princess, your obective is to 
                      rescue the princess. But first you need to go through all 
                      of the obstacles blocking your way to the princess. In each 
                      level you will fight enemies that are prventing you from 
                      getting to the princess. Each level will decrease the number
                      of enemies but increase the health of the enemies making the
                      game harder. In the gave you will be controling a peasant 
                      unsing its bow to shoot the enemies. If you successfully
                      kill all the enemies from hitting them mutiple times, you 
                      will proceed onto the next level. Every single time you touch 
                      the enemies will result in a deduction in health. There is
                      healing in levels where you need to touch the heart to increse 
                      your health. In this project my partner and I thought of 
                      many ideas to make a game. It took some time but we came 
                      down to one idea. My partner mainly worked on the code but
                      whenever he felt like he was stuck or that he could not figure
                      something out then I would help him. Most of the time I would
                      work on the documentations and if I was done with the
                      documentations then I would watch my partner code and guide
                      him to code the project. During the progress of creating the
                      game we were able to seek help form our nehboring groups. We
                      were able to help them when they need help and they helped
                      us when we needed help. Finally, we were able to complete 
                      the final version of the game that is show above.</p>
