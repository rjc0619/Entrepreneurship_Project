                    <strong>Work experience</strong>
                        <p>I haven't worked at a real paying job yet due to my age
                        but, I hope to start working in the near future. When I 
                        was in the club California Juinor Scholarship Foundation,
                        I would mainly be the cashier for the event I am volunteering 
                        for. I would always sign up to help with the food and I would 
                        end up being the person that collects the money form the
                        people who have purchased food to support the charity the
                        event is based on. Even though I have not worked yet I have
                        experience in volunteer work, here are a few:</p> 
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Glide</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Glide is a place where people go to serve food to 
                            people who do not have easy access to food everyday.</li>
                            <li>There were many jobs that you can do at Glide such as 
                            cleaning the tables, putting other food onto other peoples
                            plates and many more.</li>
                            <li>Many people were rushing into the dining area while 
                            I was contiuously placing meat on the plates</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Fire Fundraiser</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 2018, there were 6 fires in California that 
                            affected the air quality in many places in California.
                            Due to the fires, many people were left homeless, without
                            food, and with no access to basic daily necessities. </li>
                            <li>As a member of Key Club at Dublin High, I was 
                            challenged to raise money to be donated to those in 
                            need. I decided that I wanted to go above and beyond
                            and I was able to raise over $200 for the fundraiser 
                            in 1 week.</li>
                            <li>When I asked my peers to donate, they were more 
                            than happy to and were very supportive of me.</li>
                        </ul>
