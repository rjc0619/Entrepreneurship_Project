        <p class="card-text">Hi my name is Richard Chung, I am currently a freshman
        at Dublin High School. I am looking forward to seeking and pursuing my
        hobbies. Currently I do not know what I want to do when I grow up but I 
        am testing electives at my school to see where my true passion lies. I 
        have found a passion in volleyball and talking to friends most of my time</p> 
        <p>Skills that I have are being organized, hard working, determined, social,
        entertaining, motivating, understanding, and many more. I have never
        worked because of my age but I look forward to finding a job next year 
        or my junior year. By myself, I have raised over $200 to donate to people
        who have lost their homes to the Camp Fire in Paradise that happened in
        November of 2018.</p>
        <p>In school, I was nominated for homecoming prince, I participated in 
        the homecoming activities such as the skit and the float build, and also
        I have volunteered at a local festival to help out at booths. I have also 
        volunteered at the Glide Memorial Church and I helped serve hot meals to
        homeless people. 
        </p>
