                                <p>In the game, Save the Princess, your obective is to 
                                rescue the princess. But first you need to go through all 
                                of the obstacles blocking your way to the princess. In each 
                                level you will fight enemies that are prventing you from 
                                getting to the princess. Each level will decrease the number
                                of enemies but increase the health of the enemies making the
                                game harder. In the gave you will be controling a peasant 
                                unsing its bow to shoot the enemies. If you successfully
                                kill all the enemies from hitting them mutiple times, you 
                                will proceed onto the next level. Every single time you touch 
                                the enemies will result in a deduction in health. There is
                                healing in levels where you need to touch the heart to increse 
                                your health. In this project my partner and I thought of 
                                many ideas to make a game. It took some time but we came 
                                down to one idea. My partner mainly worked on the code but
                                whenever he felt like he was stuck or that he could not figure
                                something out then I would help him. Most of the time I would
                                work on the documentations and if I was done with the
                                documentations then I would watch my partner code and guide
                                him to code the project. During the progress of creating the
                                game we were able to seek help form our nehboring groups. We
                                were able to help them when they needed help and they helped
                                us when we needed help. Finally, we were able to complete 
                                the final version of the game that is show below.</p>

                                in order to obtain the emerald stone. In the story
                                you will come across a evil group of theives that 
                                is called the Jaguars. The Jaguars have the emerald stone!
                                So it is the players job to capture the emerald 
                                stone before they begin taking over the world. In
                                the game, you will come across two options that is 
                                up to you to choose, so make sure to choose wisely. In
                                the project both my partner and I put a lot of 
                                effort and time into the project. We both wanted 
                                the game to be challenging but still really fun.
                                During the progression of our project my partner,
                                Ananya and I worked on the code. I was also in charge
                                of creating the storyline so that the game would be
                                more entertaining. Overall, our hard work paid off
                                and the end result turned out better than we thought
                                it would be. The code to my project is below.</p>
