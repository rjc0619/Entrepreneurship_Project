        <p>I am experienced in Promoting products, selling products, Socializing,
        Cooperating with others, being entertaining, aiding others, motivating 
        others, and having strong analytical skills. </p>
        <strong>Work experience</strong>
        <p>I haven't worked at a real paying job yet due to my age but, I hope 
        to start working in the near future. I have not found what I would like 
        to major in for college nor do I know what I want to do when I grow up. 
        As of right now, I am testing the electives that I'm interested in at my 
        school. Even though I have not worked yet I have experience in volunteer 
        work, here are a few:</p>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Glide</h6>
        <p>Glide is a place where people go to serve food to people who do not 
        have easy access to food everyday. I was called behind the counter to put
        protein onto peoples plates. But there were many jobs that you can do at 
        Glide such as cleaning the tables, putting other food onto other peoples 
        plates and many more.</p>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Fire Fundraiser</h6>
        <p>In 2018, there was 6 fires in California that affected the air quality
        in many places in California. Due to the fires, many people were left 
        homeless, without food, and with no access to basic daily necessities. 
        As a member of Key Club at Dublin High, I was challenged to raise money
        to be donated to those in need. I was able to raise over $200 for the 
        fundraiser in 1 week. When I asked my peers to donate, they were more 
        than happy to and were very supportive of me.</p>
