                                    aware of what the world famous water bottle is: hydro
                                    flask. This water bottle is able to withstand the 
                                    temperature of cool beverages for up to twenty-four 
                                    hours and warm beverages no more than twelve. A design
                                    like this is beneficial to many, however, has a downside
                                    to the cost. The cost of hydro flasks ranges from 
                                    $40-$60. This is the problem we are facing because 
                                    we want to expand the number of people who want to 
                                    drink temperature insulated beverages. Our mission is
                                    to bring this opportunity to everyone in a more 
                                    cost-efficient and inclusive way. We mainly want to 
                                    reach out to any age audience (specifically teens to 
                                    young adults) and people involved in athletics or any
                                    audiences who require cold or warm beverages. A solution
                                    is needed to this problem because drinking beverages 
                                    based on the temperature you want is a simple thing 
                                    and should be accessible to whoever wants it. When 
                                    things are too expensive, it can be very discouraging.
                                    Although insulated reusable water bottles have their 
                                    benefits to people and their environment, many people
                                    who don't have insulated water bottles will turn to 
                                    cold plastic water bottles that people just put in the 
                                    fridge. Many water bottles are not disposed of in the 
                                    correct disposal causing most water bottles to end up 
                                    in landfill or even in the ocean. When water bottles 
                                    end up in the ocean most sea creature will mistake 
                                    the water bottle with food. Later on, they find out 
                                    that what they just consumed is indigestible and die 
                                    because it's too late to be saved.</p>
