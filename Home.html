                        <p>Hi, my name is Richard Chung, I am currently
                    a freshman at Dublin High School. Before, I was looking forward
                    to seeking and discovering what I want to do in the future. I did 
                    not know what I wanted to do when I grow up but after taking 
                    the time to think about what I want from the job, I noticed that
                    working in the medical feild will greatly satisfy my wants for
                    my future job. The medical feild will allow me to help others 
                    as well as socialize with others. I have already found a passion
                    for volleyball and collaborating with friends. I want to 
                    pursue something that I can enjoy and something that will allow
                    me to live a happy and healthy life. </p> 
                        <p>Skills that I have are being organized, determined, social, 
                    entertaining, motivating, understanding, and many more. I have 
                    never worked because of my age but I look forward to finding a 
                    job next year or my junior year. Then, I will be able to see which
                    of my skills shine and which of them don't. Even though I have
                    never worked, I have plently of work experience from volunteering.
                    By myself, I have raised over $200 to donate to people who 
                    have lost their homes to the Camp Fire in Paradise that 
                    happened in November of 2018. I have taught myself ways of 
                    promoting things for a good cause to help others fundraise. 
                    I also learned that you don't get whatever you want until you 
                    work hard enough. By overcoming my own challenges I am able 
                    to realize my capabilities and can use those skills to conquer
                    upcoming ones.</p>
                        <p>In school, I was nominated for homecoming prince, and I participated
                    in the homecoming activities such as the skit and the float build.
                    Also, I have volunteered at a local festival to help out at booths. 
                    I have volunteered at the Glide Memorial Church and I helped 
                    serve hot meals to homeless people. Feeling the rush of people 
                    constantly come into the dining area motivated me to work harder.
                    I learned that when it comes to me working under pressure, I tend to 
                    work diligently but still quickly so I can complete the task. The 
                    courses I am currently taking are the normal classes that a freshman
                    would take but I plan to take courses over the summer to challenge myself
                    and push me to work harder, so, I do not waste time over summer 
                    break sitting at home and doing nothing.</p>
                        <p>I plan to spend my summer wisely by challenging myself with 
                    higher division math courses and finding more ways to become involved
                    in my community. In the future, I look forward to bringing my 
                    experiences and skills to a great company. I hope to discover my
                    abilities and skills from my courses and volunteer opportunities.
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my about me and I hope you 
                    enjoy the rest of the website!</p>
