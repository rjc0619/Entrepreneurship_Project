        <strong>Work experience</strong>
        <p>I haven't worked for jobs yet due to my age but I hope to start working
        in the near future. I also have not found what I would like to major in for
        college nor do I know what I want to do when I grow up but as of right now
        I am testing the electives that I'm intrested in at my school. Even though
        I have not worked yet I have experience in volunteer work, here are a few.</p>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Glide</h6>
        <p>Glide is a place where people go to serve food to people who do not have
        easy access to food everyday. I was called behind the counter to put protein
        onto peoples plates. But there were many jobs that you can do at glide
        such as cleaning the tables, putting other food onto other peoples plates
        and many more.</p>
        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Fire Fundraiser</h6>
        <p>In 2018 there was 6 fires in California that effected the air quality
        in many places making the air hazardous to breath in. I was in a club called
        Key Club in that time and they were challenging student to raise money for
        people who have lost their homes and their personal belongings and for
        all the supplies they need in their every day life. I ended up raising
        over $200 for the fundraiser in 1 week thank to the peers who donated 
        when I asked them.</p>
