                <p class="card-text">Hi my name is Richard Chung, I am currently
                a freshman at Dublin High School. I am looking forward to seeking
                and discovering what I want to do in the future. Currently I do 
                not know what I want to do when I grow up but I am testing electives
                at my school to see where my true passion lies. I have found a passion in volleyball
                and collaborating with friends most of the time. I also want to be 
                able to pursue something that I can enjoy myself. And something 
                that can support myself well enough so that I can live a happy
                and healthy life.</p> 
                <p>Skills that I have are being organized, determined, social,
                entertaining, motivating, understanding, and many more. I have never
                worked because of my age but I look forward to finding a job next
                year or my junior year. Then, I will be able to see which of my 
                skills shine and which of them don't. By myself, I have raised over 
                $200 to donate to people who have lost their homes to the Camp Fire 
                in Paradise that happened in November of 2018. I have taught myself 
                ways of promoting things for a good cause and I also learned that
                you don't get whatever you want until you work hard enough and 
                until you go through things that you have never thought you would 
                ever do before.</p>
                <p>In school, I was nominated for homecoming prince, I participated
                in the homecoming activities such as the skit and the float build, 
                and also I have volunteered at a local festival to help out at booths. 
                I have also volunteered at the Glide Memorial Church and I helped 
                serve hot meals to homeless people. Feeling the rush of people 
                consantly come into the dinning area motivated me to work harder.
                I learned that when it comes to me under pressure I tend to 
                work diligently but still rush so I can complete the task. The 
                courses I am currently taking are the normal classes that a freshman
                would take but I plan to take courses over the summer to challenge
                and push me to work harder and so I do not waste time over summer 
                break chilling at home and doing nothing.</p>
                <p>In the future I look forward to experiencing what it really 
                means to work for a company and also what I have to offer to my 
                future. I have had experience in voulenteer work but never from
                working in a job. I hope to discover my abilites and skills form 
                working. Thank you for taking the time to read my about me and I
                hope you enjoy the rest of the website as well.</p>
